Additional Information:

For part 2, REPL is demonstrated through user input. The user does not ask a question in the terminal, instead fills in the blanks (as prompted in a REPL manner) to complete the question. Both search queries specified by the project guidelines are supported in this manner.

Note: for the entries, they must input the name as it appears in the table. For example, the correct name would be "O. Gonzalez" not "Gonzalez" or "CSC171" not "csc171"". Additionally, the database is reset for each part, so every part of the project will use the original data in Appendix A

All other functions as demonstrated through code in my main.c file and shown in the terminal's output.
